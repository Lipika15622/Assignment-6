    "description" : "Microsoft 365 is a product family of productivity software, collaboration and cloud-based services owned by Microsoft. It encompasses online services such as Outlook.com, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, programs formerly marketed under the name Microsoft Office (including applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook on Microsoft Windows, macOS, mobile devices, and on the web), enterprise products and services associated with these products such as Exchange Server, SharePoint, and Viva Engage. It also covers subscription plans encompassing these products, including those that include subscription-based licenses to desktop and mobile software, and hosted email and intranet services.The branding Office 365 was introduced in 2010 to refer to a subscription-based software as a service platform for the corporate market, including hosted services such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync Server, and Office on the web. Some plans also included licenses for the Microsoft Office 2010 software. Upon the release of Office 2013, Microsoft began to promote the service as the primary distribution model for the Microsoft Office suite, adding consumer-focused plans integrating with services such as OneDrive and Skype, and emphasizing ongoing feature updates (as opposed to non-subscription licenses, where new versions require purchase of a new license, and do not receive feature updates)."

The CMDB holds all enterprise data, including master, transactional, and configuration data. In practical terms, any assets that are part of a business, from data centers, employees, to employee laptops, are known as 'CI Items' in the CMDB. These components, which make up an enterprise, can be configured, tracked, audited, and the relationships between the various CI items can be assessed.ServiceNow script is written in JavaScript, with database queries being made using a proprietary object-oriented API called Glide.[39] In July 2023, the company released a generative AI speech-to-code feature, which the marketing research firm Valoir estimated could reduce relevant work time by 40 percent."

    "description" : "The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of practices and a framework for IT activities such as IT service management (ITSM) and IT asset management (ITAM) that focus on aligning IT services with the needs of the business.The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL®) is a set of best practices designed to describe common approaches that IT service management (ITSM) can take to align IT services with business needs and deliver value to the organization.The current version of ITIL offers a series of professional certifications designed to validate an individual's level of competency in specific areas that ITIL covers, or to demonstrate an individual's level of competency in the overall set of ITIL best practices.As with many professional certifications, determining the precise value of earning an IT credential is difficult to calculate. However, it is widely understood that a combination of tangible and intangible factors make certifications a worthwhile investment of time and money for both organizations and individuals.This article discusses the value of ITIL certifications to both organizations and individuals within the context of these various tangible and intangible factors. Data in this article is based on survey results from respondents with various degrees of ITIL certification, who shared specific organizational improvements that were made possible due to the knowledge gained while earning their ITIL certifications. These specific organizational benefits are clear examples of the value of ITIL certifications.ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are neither organization-specific nor technology-specific. It was designed to allow organizations to establish a baseline.It is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvements. There is no formal independent third-party compliance assessment available to demonstrate ITIL compliance in an organization. Certification in ITIL is only available to individuals and not organizations. Since 2021, the ITIL trademark has been owned by PeopleCert."

  "description":"Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can access a web application through a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.For a web app to operate, it needs a web server, application server and database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database stores any necessary information.Web applications typically have short development cycles and small development teams. Developers write most web apps in JavaScript, HTML5 or CSS. Client-side programming typically utilizes these languages, which help build an application's front-end. Server-side programming creates the scripts a web app will use. Languages such as Python, Java and Ruby are commonly used in server-side programming."

One is the iOS platform from Apple Inc. The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line of iPhone smartphones. The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and other smart devices.Although there are some similarities between these two platforms when building applications, developing for iOS vs. developing for Android involves using different software development kits (SDKs) and different development toolchain. While Apple uses iOS exclusively for its own devices, Google makes Android available to other companies provided they meet specific requirements such as including certain Google applications on the devices they ship. Developers can build apps for hundreds of millions of devices by targeting both of these platforms."

  "description":"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters .Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each  being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string."
